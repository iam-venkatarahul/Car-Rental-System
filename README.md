# Car-Rental-System
A Car Rental System developed using Spring Boot is a web application designed to manage the rental process of vehicles. It allows customers to view available cars, make reservations, and complete transactions. The system also includes administrative functionalities to manage inventory, customer records, and rental transactions. The application leverages the power of Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, to build a scalable and robust backend service.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: For building the core backend application.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
H2/SQL Database: For persistent data storage.
Thymeleaf (Optional): For rendering the frontend (if not using an API-based approach with a frontend framework like Angular/React).
Spring REST API: To expose RESTful APIs if the application is part of a larger microservices architecture.
Hibernate: For object-relational mapping.
Payment API Integration: (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).
JUnit: For unit and integration testing.
Swagger: For API documentation.
